# DictionaryLookup-NN

A small handcrafted neural network that can look up keys in a dictionary (with 2^n entries) and return its corresponding values.
Returns 0 if the key is not found. The weights are already preset to their correct value.

Mostly implemented to test the keras API, usefulness may be limited.
